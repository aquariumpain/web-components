# Example Component

This is an example component. All components must have a `README.md` file, an `index.html` file, `index.css` file, an `index.js` file, and an `examples` folder with at least one example on how to use the component.

The `README.md` file must also have a section about the requirements of the component.

Please also make sure to include a link to your examples on [rawgit](http://rawgit.com/).
